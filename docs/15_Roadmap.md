# Project Roadmap: Flipper Zero Clone

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for the custom Flipper Zero clone. Each phase builds upon the previous one to ensure consistent progress, testing, and integration of features.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
> Goal: Establish development environment and basic functionality

- [ ] Set up Git repository and documentation structure
- [ ] Initialize PlatformIO/Arduino project
- [ ] Set up OLED display (test text & menu rendering)
- [ ] Implement input handler for physical buttons
- [ ] Create basic menu navigation system

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Module Prototyping (Weeks 2–3)
> Goal: Integrate core modules and verify hardware functionality

- [ ] **IR Transceiver**
  - [ ] Receive NEC codes
  - [ ] Transmit saved codes

- [ ] **NFC (PN532)**
  - [ ] Detect NFC tags
  - [ ] Read MIFARE UID

- [ ] **Sub-GHz RF Module**
  - [ ] Capture raw signals
  - [ ] Replay signals (basic)

---

## 📍 Phase 3: UI/UX & Storage Integration (Weeks 4–5)
> Goal: Enhance interaction experience and implement storage

- [ ] Refactor menu with scrolling & icons
- [ ] Save IR/NFC/RF data to SD card (SPI interface)
- [ ] File manager for viewing & selecting stored signals
- [ ] Add settings menu (e.g., brightness, timeout)

---

## 📍 Phase 4: USB Tools & Expansion (Week 6)
> Goal: Add USB HID emulation and prepare for extension

- [ ] Implement USB HID keyboard/mouse (ESP32 native USB or USB host shield)
- [ ] Add GPIO tool: simple HIGH/LOW toggle
- [ ] Power consumption optimization (sleep mode, LED usage)

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Final Polish & Packaging (Weeks 7–8)
> Goal: Finalize system for daily use and public release

- [ ] Create icon-based UI (visual polish)
- [ ] Add firmware updater support (OTA or USB)
- [ ] Hardware enclosure design (3D printed or CNC)
- [ ] Conduct full integration test
- [ ] Prepare v1.0 release notes & user manual

## ✅ Future Ideas / Stretch Goals
- Bluetooth remote control via smartphone
- Custom scripting language for signals
- WiFi sniffing or signal analyzer
- GPS tracker module support
- Cloud sync of saved profiles
