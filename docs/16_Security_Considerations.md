# Security Considerations

This document outlines the ethical, legal, and technical security concerns related to the development and use of this multi-tool device.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical & Legal Use

### ‚ùó Disclaimer
This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. Any misuse of this device for unauthorized access or disruption of networks/devices is strictly discouraged and may be **illegal** under national and international laws.

### ‚úÖ Good Practices
- Only test with devices and networks you **own or have explicit permission** to interact with.
- Respect privacy, consent, and property of others.
- Avoid use in public or sensitive environments (e.g., airports, hospitals).

---

## üîê Software-Level Security

### Input Validation
- Ensure robust parsing and validation of incoming IR/NFC/SubGHz data to avoid crashes or code injection.
- Avoid hardcoding dangerous command sequences.

### Memory & Buffer Management
- Prevent buffer overflows (especially with signal decoding).
- Watch for memory leaks, especially when saving or reading from SD card.

### USB HID Safety
- If HID functionality is implemented (keyboard/mouse emulation), make sure:
  - Scripts are reviewed before execution
  - Dangerous payloads (e.g., autorun commands) are sandboxed or clearly labeled
  - Only triggered manually, not via remote signals

---

## üîß Hardware Risks & Countermeasures

### Signal Interference
- Device may inadvertently jam or interfere with legitimate signals.
  - Include signal strength limits
  - Disable continuous/repeat transmission by default

### Data Leakage
- Do not log sensitive signals (e.g., garage codes, remote keys) without user awareness.
- Encrypt or obfuscate stored data if needed (optional advanced feature).

### Unauthorized Access
- Consider a PIN code lock or boot-time authentication for production-grade builds.
- Limit debug serial output in final firmware to avoid exposing device behavior.

---

## üß™ Responsible Development

- Always document any potentially sensitive features with **clear warnings**.
- Include toggle switches or compile-time flags for experimental modules.
- Encourage community feedback and open disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Final Notes

This project mimics capabilities of a penetration testing tool. While it can be fun and educational, misuse could have **real-world consequences**. Build and share responsibly.
